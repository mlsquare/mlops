<section id="why-mlops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-mlops">Why MLOps?</h3>
<p>First and foremost, let us swallow the bitter pill - ML is <em>just</em> a piece of technology like any other to solve a business problem for which somebody needs to pay for. It means that unless people <em>use</em> it and <em>pay</em> for this technology (models), no matter how sophisticated and cool do they sound, they byte the dust like most ML initiatives do.</p>
<p>Not just that - industry needs and loves determinism, accountability and reliability, which is the antithesis on which ML lives and thrives. MLOps is about addressing this inherent design challenge using a combination of tools and processes. Without which one has to appeal to luck to achieve the desirable. And we know from experience that luck favors the prepared.</p>
<p>This collection of notes on MLOps is about that preparation to manage the entire life cycle of an ML product, holistically and comprehensively. That is, for example, the ML system must be performant, explainable, reliable, fair and transparent, responsive and responsible, controllable, cost effective, collaborative, and many others, all which will discussed in detail later in the course.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-a-course-on-mlops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-a-course-on-mlops">Why <em>A</em> course on MLOps?</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Underestimation of Technical Debt
<ul>
<li>Developing ML systems involves significant technical complexities that are often underestimated, chiefly arising out of model-centric pedagogy.</li>
<li>Unlike traditional software development, ML systems require continuous monitoring and iteration of the situated environment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fundamental Differences from Traditional Software Development
<ul>
<li>Traditional software development assumes a stable environment and known requirements.</li>
<li>ML systems, however, must adapt to changing environments and data, making it impossible to assume a perfect product at deployment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uncertain Data Environment
<ul>
<li>AI systems inherently make mistakes and must be designed to handle continuous change and evolution.</li>
<li>A good model in the lab does not guarantee performance in production, necessitating robust MLOps practices.</li>
<li>The deployment and monitoring of ML systems differ fundamentally from traditional software.</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring and iteration are essential for maintaining model performance and relevance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operationalizing ML
<ul>
<li>Operationalizing ML is crucial for deriving value from AI systems, aligning them with business objectives and real-world applications. This can be a non-trivial activity, if not impossible in some cases.</li>
<li>This mindset is essential for understanding the practical aspects of ML deployment and maintenance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>A course on MLOps exposes the developer or system designer to this varying challenges in the life cycle of ML (which is perpetual). This is entirely different from how one could solve an ML problem in academic settings where, more often than not, model novelty is incentivized over utility.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-this-course-on-mlops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-course-on-mlops">Why <em>THIS</em> course on MLOps?</h3>
<p>There are many great resources available on the web in terms of books, blogs, courses, and tool documentation. Why yet another one? A legit question.</p>
<p>At a philosophical level - there are two objectives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Fight the SOTA syndrome:</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Thanks to chatGPT, it all seems to be about LLMs - building new models, spinning new shiny applications built around those LLMs both open and closed included. These new shiny objects exacerbated an already sick situation - a situation where building models (model.train) showing 0.01% (or even less) increase in accuracy is chased and cherished – all about State-of-the-Art (SOTA).</p>
<p>While we must work hard and smart to move the needle, and it might be satisfying and fulfilling intellectually – unfortunately, it (chasing SOTA) is neither necessary nor sufficient to build <em>reliable</em> systems consisting of at least one ML component. There is lot more one has to consider in building and managing such systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritizes utility over novelty:</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is a boring job to be done. However, contrary to the prejudice, in the due course, you will learn that, indeed, solving for utility and overcoming the challenges along the way, is a rewarding journey in itself. Give no cult status to SOTA.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>More concretely, there are some limitations of current MLOps Resources - they are notably:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Practitioner-Focused Literature
<ul>
<li>Most current MLOps books and resources are aimed at practitioners.</li>
<li>These resources focus heavily on tools and practices without structured assessment components.</li>
<li>Often they anchor on specific framework/tool set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need for Academic Assessment
<ul>
<li>In academia, assessments are a crucial part of the learning process.</li>
<li>This material should not only teach concepts but also include tests to evaluate understanding.</li>
<li>Testing is fundamental to learning and ensures that students grasp and can apply MLOps concepts effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comprehensive Curriculum
<ul>
<li>The course should cover not only MLOps but also ML system design and the operationalization of models.</li>
<li>Integrating these elements ensures a holistic understanding of both the development and deployment aspects of ML projects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>So the chief difference is - most of the resources are meant for practitioners. But this set of notes is meant both for students who can learn the tools and processes, and apply them and also for practitioners (who can learn the principles). But some of the challenges are more systemic and pervasive outlined below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Variability in MLOps Practices
<ul>
<li>MLOps processes and practices vary significantly between individuals and organizations.</li>
<li>Unlike DevOps in the software industry, which has become a mainstream discipline with standardized practices, MLOps is still relatively young.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Absence of Standard Vocabulary
<ul>
<li>There is no non-denominational vocabulary in MLOps, leading to inconsistencies in terminology and practices.</li>
<li>Standardizing terminology and processes is crucial for effective communication and collaboration within and between organizations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Knowledge Diffusion and Skill Gap
<ul>
<li>Traditional academic institutions typically propagate certain ideas and knowledge that get absorbed and amplified in the industry. But the reverse diffusion is often delayed.</li>
<li>There can be a lag between what academia offers and what the industry needs, especially in rapidly evolving fields like ML.</li>
<li>set of templates (of code bases and also of materialized principles) that anybody can use in the Industry which improves the overall employee productivity of the employee</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No Institutionalized MLOps Thinking
<ul>
<li>Institutionalizing MLOps in academic programs ensures that students are trained in industry-relevant skills from the start.</li>
<li>This approach can help standardize the quality and relevance of ML education, making graduates industry-ready.</li>
<li>Introduce a conceptual framework of models, actors and actions involved and a vocabulary to describe the complex ML dev cycle</li>
<li>Provide a holistic view of ML - going beyond chasing performance metrics</li>
<li>practice the principle <em>theory-with-code and code-with-theory</em> so that every principle is practicable, and every practice has a principle</li>
<li>develop good (conceptual) models and <em>principles</em> which industry can adopt</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
