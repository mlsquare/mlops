This idea is recently explored in the paper [Understanding Dataset Difficulty with $\\nu$-Usable Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08420). The motivation for the authors was different, however. They want to characterize the dataset difficulty.\n",

Note that $I_{\\mathcal{V}}(X \\rightarrow Y) = \\mathcal{E}_{x,y \\sim P(X,Y)}[PVI(x,y)]$.\n",

But informally, from information theory point of view,  $\\nu\\text{-information}$ is the information gain due to conditioning (observing X). As a matter of fact, it closely resembles mutual information $I(X,Y) = H(Y)-H(Y|X)$ where $H(X)$ is the entropy of $Y$ and $H(Y|X)$ is the conditional (on $X$) entropy of $Y$. But the difference is in how $X$ and $Y$ are related.  $\\nu\\text{-information}$ restricts the mappings $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ to the admissable class of functions that can be learnt under the hypothesis class $\\mathcal{V}$ and not _any_ function which is used in classical mutual information (in fact, it is not specified).\n",
